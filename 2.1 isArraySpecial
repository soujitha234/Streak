/*An array is considered special if every pair of its adjacent elements contains two numbers with different parity.
You are given an array of integers nums. Return true if nums is a special array, otherwise, return false.
Example 2:
Input: nums = [2,1,4]
Output: true
Explanation:
There is only two pairs: (2,1) and (1,4), and both of them contain numbers with different parity. So the answer is true.

Example 3:
Input: nums = [4,3,1,6]
Output: false
Explanation:
nums[1] and nums[2] are both odd. So the answer is false.*/
/*parity = even/odd*/
